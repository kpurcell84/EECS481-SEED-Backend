REASONING

- Hardcoded 3 fictional patients and 1 fictional doctor
- One patient yes, one patient maybe, one patient no for sepsis

- Researched normal metrics as well as sleep patterns
- Researched sepsis metrics and combined them with knowledge from meeting with Dr. Cornell
- Developed ranges of normal values, questionable values, and sepsis values
- Randomly generate data within the ranges based on hardcoded patterns unique to each patient
- Manually created sleep patterns representative of normal sleep and sepsis sleep
- Adjusted quantitative data based on activity (sleep or passive or active)
- Based on pattern during time of sleep, set sleep patterns accordingly

- Made qualitative survey answers based on pattern

- Generate alerts based on when they should be triggered based on patterns

- Train classification algorithm with data
